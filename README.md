# bump_detection_modele

This repositry contains the code that i used to detect bump detection using machine learning model neural network and tensorflow library.
- capturing images using camera 
- processing images by the model and then return to conductor via the notifs if there is a speed bump or not 
- a cache memory to memorise the speed bumps of the route
