#A New Wave of Road Safety: The Speed Bump Detection Project using Machine Learning and TensorFlow
As part of a personal project, I developed a speed bump detection system using a neural network machine learning model and the TensorFlow library. The system uses a camera to capture images of the road and a memory cache to store the location of speed bumps and send notifications to the conductor via the application. The model was trained to recognize speed bumps in the images and predict their location in real time.

I believe this project has practical applications in enhancing road safety for drivers and passengers. The use of machine learning and TensorFlow allowed for accurate detection of speed bumps, reducing the risk of accidents and damage to vehicles.


- capturing images using camera 
- processing images by the model and then return to conductor via the notifs if there is a speed bump or not 
- a cache memory to memorise the speed bumps of the route
